 * Create a class called OffByOne that implements CharacterComparator.
 * Add tests to TestOffByOne for the equalChars method in the OffByOne class.
 * Complete the equalChars method and verify that it works.
 * Add a new method that overloads isPalindrome.
 * Add tests to TestPalindrome that tests your new method in isPalindrome. Itâ€™s ok to use new OffByOne() for these tests.
 * Complete the new method in isPalindrome and verify that it works.
